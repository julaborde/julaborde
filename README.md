# Julien Laborde-Peyré

I am a French engineering student at CentraleSupélec, currently in my penultimate year, specializing in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and applied statistics.

Starting in September 2025, I will spend one year in Montreal for a research-focused internship. My main interest lies in deep learning for medical image analysis, with a focus on computer vision techniques applied to healthcare data.
